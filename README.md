# Under-the-Radar
Top-down 2D stealth game developed in Godot as part of my A-Level Computer Science NEA (Sept 2023 - Mar 2024).

## Overview
*Under the Radar* is a 2D stealth game featuring dynamic AI-based pathfinding with custom A* algorithm implementation. The game featured enemies with vision-cone detection, patrol and chase behaviours, and interactive objects such as doors, switches and lasers. 

## Key Features
- Custom A* pathfinding for enemy AI
- Patrol and chase behaviours using enemy state management
- Vision-cone detection mechanics
- Interactive objects: doors, switches, and lasers
- Player HUD with health, inventory, and objectives

## Skills Developed
- Object-oriented programming in GDScript
- AI pathfinding and state management
- Software development lifecycle experience
- Testing, debugging, and performance optimisation
- Written documentation throughout development

## Note
The source files are a part of my NEA coursework and are no longer available. This repository serves as documentation of the project and the core skills developed during its creation.
